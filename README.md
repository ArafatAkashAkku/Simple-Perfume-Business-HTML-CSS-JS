# Simple Perfume Business

A perfume website is an online platform dedicated to selling, showcasing, and providing information about various perfumes and fragrances. Perfume websites typically have an extensive catalog of perfumes and fragrances. Users can browse through different categories of scents, including men's, women's, unisex, and niche fragrances. Many perfume websites allow customers to leave reviews and ratings for the perfumes they've purchased. These reviews can be helpful for potential buyers in making their choices.

The folowing code is a simple frontend code using html, css and js. I practiced it by downloading a free psd file from google.

Since it is a progressive web app, you can also install the web application in your smart phones, tablets, desktops etc.
